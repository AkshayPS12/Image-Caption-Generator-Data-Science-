Model used was [ResNET50](https://iq.opengenus.org/resnet50-architecture/) and was trained over RNNs/LSTMs. 

The model was trained on [Flickr8K](https://www.kaggle.com/shadabhussain/flickr8k) image data set. 

A custom Data Generator was enforced during training which had the work of maintaining RAM usage. 

The results obtained in any time were processed on NVIDIA 1060 3GB GPU. Major libraries used(Keras, Tensorflow)
